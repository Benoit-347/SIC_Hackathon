However, not all issues related to comprehensive data can be\n   solved only with pandas.\n\n   Instead of being a comprehensive data analytic tool, pandas is a data operation tool that has some level of analytic\n   function.\n\n   For more in-depth analysis, data operation, and data visualization in different fields, use libraries including Scipy,\n  Numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, ggbis along with pandas.

Similar terms include attributes and predictors.\n\n                    The goal of most data science projects is to predict some outcome. The feature is used for\n     Outcome                        prediction. Similar terms include dependent variable, response, goal, and output.\n\n                         Typically, each row in a table represents one record. Similar terms include recorded value, case,\n       Record                        case, example, observation, pattern, sample, etc.\n\n   In other words, to define a DataFrame using the above terms, it can be basically said that it is a two-dimensional matrix\n   consisting of a row representing each record (case) and a column representing a feature (variable).\n\n   In order to effectively process the DataFrame object, each column is designated as an index. In the case of pandas,\n   multi/hierarchical indexes can be set, so more complex data processing can be done effectively.\n\n   Please visit https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/dsintro.html#dataframe to read more about\n  DataFrame definitions and uses from a Python and pandas' perspective.", 'N/A']

About file paths\n\n  One of the many mistakes beginners make while learning Python for data processing in the first place is entering the\n  wrong path to the files to load data.\n\n  You can leave it as the basics of computing, but it\'s helpful to make sure you clean up the file paths once. Paths of files\n   in the local computer can be expressed in two ways.\n\n\n      Ex The OS uses the Windows system. If you find "sample.txt" on the desktop, it is\n         C:\\Users\\UserID\\Desktop\\sample.txt. No matter which operating system (OS) is used as well as Windows, it is\n          to find the file with an absolute path that contains all the paths passed through from the top-level root.\n\n\n       / : Move to the top-level directory (root)\n         ./ : Current same directory, can be deleted\n          ../ : Parent directory from my current location (file being created)\n          ../../ : Directory two levels higher', 'N/A']

Because\n          of the static characteristics, the former needs to rewrite all documents written with absolute paths, and the\n           latter has to create and manage absolute paths for each OS.', 'N/A']

Why is Data Tidying Necessary?\n\n  So far, we have learned to create data frames and series, or to bring in other files and turn them into data frames. In\n   fact, the most frequently encountered situation when doing such similar tasks in the field is when the data form of the\n   analysis target is abnormal.\n\n  Abnormal data refers to cases where data is missing, units do not match, or are overlapped without rules. The process\n   of organizing the abnormal data is called data tidying.\n\n   This term was coined by Hadley Wickham(http://hadley.nz/) in his paper ”Tidy Data”(Paper Link:\n   https://vita.had.co.nz/papers/tidy-data.html). The paper is available for download, so please check it out.', 'N/A']

Why is Data Tidying Necessary?\n\n   There is something that data scientists in the field always say.\n\n   ”80% of data analysis is spent on tidying and preparing data."\n\n   In addition, the reason why this work is so tedious and repetitive is because data preparation and tidying do not end in\n   a single process, but rather, requires repeatedly tidying new problems that are constantly found in the process.\n\n   Therefore, Tidy Data provides a standard method of configuring data values within a standardized data set. The\n   standard makes it easy to clean up initial data because you don’t have to start from scratch and perform new tasks\n   every time.', 'N/A']

What is time series data?\n\n  Time series data is a set of time-organized values collected over a certain time or period.\n\n    It can be explained a little more technically:\n\n         “A time series is data about one or more variables measured over a period of time at specific intervals.”\n\n  Machine learning technology is widely used for business predictive analysis. It analyzes business problems such as\n   stock price, budget, sales and asset flow, forecast maintenance and sales forecasting, and predicts future indicators by\n  composing related data such as trend, periodic theory, and seasonality together.\n\n  Pandas was created to handle financial data, and time series data analysis can be the core of data analysis using\n   Pandas.\n\n   In addition to the financial field, time series data analysis is used in various fields.\n\n   ‣ Medicine\n   ‣ Meteorology\n   ‣ Astronomy\n   ‣ Economics\n   ‣ IOT', 'N/A']

Time Series Data and Analysis used in the Real World\n\n  Time series data are sorted by time order, so there are continuous observation values. There is a high probability that\n   each data value has a correlation with each other.\n\n   To understand time series data, you should first understand how pandas represents dates, times, and intervals. Pandas\n   has many functions that can be used when transforming data at different frequencies or using a calendar that reflects\n   business days and holidays for financial calculations.\n\n  Pandas was created to handle financial data. When analyzing financial data, changing time series data into an index\n   within a data frame and using it has many advantages.\n\n  As it will be explained in the example code, when most of the external data is called and the columns of date are\n   checked, there are many cases of string or object type. It starts with converting to Pandas time series data type for\n   effective analysis.', 'N/A']
